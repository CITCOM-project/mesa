Say we run the predator prey model for 300 time steps and observe the wolf population at the end. We would like to estimate the average causal effect of the sheep birth rate on the final wolf population. From a causal testing point of view, this may allow us to investigate properties such as ``a lower sheep birth rate leads to a lower final wolf population''. Let us call this scenario \emph{low sheep fertility} and, since the predator prey model concerns food, assume that this low fertility is not caused by an insufficiency of food for the sheep. Indeed, for simplicity, let us consider only the two agent model where the sheep do not depend on grass for survival and, instead, only die off once eaten by a wolf.
